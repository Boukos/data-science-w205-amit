    "\n",
    "steps you need to take \n",
    "\n",
    "1. get an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account\n",
    "1. go to EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) Dashboard\n",
    "  - click >> **Launch Instance**\n",
    "1. find an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)\n",
    "  - try this one >> **UCB W205 Spring 2016 - ami-be0d5fd4**\n",
    "1. pick an instance type\n",
    "  - **t1.micro** is fine for just getting started\n",
    "  - you will need **m3.medium** or **m3.large** for later labs\n",
    "1. configure instance details \n",
    "  - pick an availability zone that you like/remember\n",
    "  - everything you do should be in the same zone\n",
    "1. add storage\n",
    "  - skip for now\n",
    "  - you can specify additional \"hard drives\" that you would like your VM (virtual machine) to access\n",
    "1. add tags \n",
    "  - skip\n",
    "  - conveniently name and tag stuff for when you have 100's of VM in your account and you can't find any of them\n",
    "1. configure security groups\n",
    "  - this is **SUPER IMPORTANT**\n",
    "  - you must have port 22 open for ssh otherwise you can't login\n",
    "  - you can specify open other ports now \n",
    "  - you can change this later too \n",
    "  - an open port is a \"window\" into your running VM\n",
    "  - any open port on you VM is a security risk so you want to open only the ports you need\n",
    "  - for example, if you want to run a webserver you would want port 80 open to http requests\n",
    "  - for example, if you want to run a secure webserver you would want port 443 open to https requests\n",
    "1. review and launch  \n",
    "  - if everything seems ok, then launch\n",
    "1. select key pair\n",
    "  - a popup screen will appear\n",
    "  - this is also **SUPER IMPORTANT**\n",
    "  - without the proper key pair you can't login into your new instance\n",
    "  - create is new one if you haven't done this before\n",
    "  - or choose an existing one so you don't end up w/ too many\n",
    "  - i called mine \"foo\" which allows me to download a file called **`foo.pem`**\n",
    "  - once you download this secret file you can LAUNCH\n",
    "1. go to the EC2 dashboard\n",
    "  - go to \"running instances\" to check on the status\n",
    "  - it takes a few minutes for the instance to get created and boot up\n",
